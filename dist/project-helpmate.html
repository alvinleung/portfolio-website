              <p>For some demographics, such as people with disabilities and seniors, household chores can be an
                incredible burden.
                However, they may not have the money to hire a professional and/or feel hesitant about inviting a

              </h3>
              <p>
                HelpMate is a community-based task finding application that allows you to help their community
                members with household
                chores. The app provides an easy way for young people to connect with their communities while
                simultaneously earning
                some money or volunteer hours to put towards their education.

              <h2>Hunting for an App idea</h2>
              <p>
                In a feedback session with our instructors, we realised that our app idea is working in a very crowded
                problem space.
                After some research, it was apparent that if we want to differentiate ourselves from the competing apps,
                we have to
                narrow down the audience scope and focus on polishing the experience for their use cases.

                Experience map is
                also used to identify design opportunities when coming up with app features.

              <h2>Design Principles</h2>
              <p>
                Based on the target audience insight, we established a set of design principles which guide our design
                decisions

                  <h4>Safety & Trust</h4>
                  <p>
                    Unlike Craigslist, HelpMate requires that users are verified with the app in order to create or
                    accept tasks. Helpers
                    and Clients are able to discuss with each other before committing to a task, and leave reviews on
                    their performance. A
                    check-in system instills a sense of assurance for the completion of a task.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <h4>Flexibility & Support</h4>
                  <p>
                    Students may find it hard to commit to a traditional part-time job due fluctuating schedules.
                    HelpMate’s scheduling
                    flexibility allows Helpers and Clients to organize an appointment without the rigidity of a formal
                    job. In the event of
                    an emergency, users are given the option to reschedule their tasks.

                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <h4>Community</h4>
                  <p>
                    We believe there’s more to the relationship between Helpers and Clients than merely monetary
                    exchange. HelpMate seeks to
                    connect different individuals in the community through helping each other and encouraging building
                    relationships, and
                    not only hiring someone to get the job done.

                To see how the design is performing, the prototype was being tested with 5 University students and 1
                full-time worker.
                Utilising a user testing script created by our group member Jessie Li, we also take this chance to get
                additional user
                feedback for the general design direction.

                results. After identifying themes in the test result, we labeled them with different priority based on
                the impact of the
                core app experience.

              <h2>Project Takeaway</h2>
              <p>
                Because of the scope and time constraint of the course, except usability testing, we were working with
                our
                secondary
                research(ie. reddit, reading papers) and assumptions has to be made. We are aware that this is not
                ideal,
                however as a
                design exercise that focuses on the craft of creating user interfaces, I still think this is a
                successful
                project. We
                went through arguments and arguments from the overall direction to the finest details of button
                placements. The result
                is a child of this amazing push and pull dynamics of the team.

              </p>
              <p>
                Working with these experienced teammates, this project has taught me an important lesson on the attitude
                of team
                collaboration and the importance of sharing ideas with the team. As a “perfectionist”, I used to have a
                very bad habit
                of holding an idea to myself and refine it before sharing it with the design team, because I was so self
                conscious about
                any criticism towards “my idea”. Through this project, I learned to put my ego aside and share
                unfinished work with
                colleagues. Couldn't say that I fully overcame this aspect of myself for now, I’ll still get upset
                sometimes when people
                say not so good things about my design. However, now I am aware of this tendency of mine when designing,
                I can figure
                out ways to deal with it and hopefully slowly I can internalise it.
