                  incredible burden.
                  However, they may not have the money to hire a professional and/or feel hesitant about inviting a

                <p>
                  HelpMate is a community-based task finding application that allows you to help their community
                  members with household
                  chores. The app provides an easy way for young people to connect with their communities while
                  simultaneously earning
                  some money or volunteer hours to put towards their education.

                <p>
                  In a feedback session with our instructors, we realised that our app idea is working in a very crowded
                  problem space.
                  After some research, it was apparent that if we want to differentiate ourselves from the competing
                  apps,
                  we have to
                  narrow down the audience scope and focus on polishing the experience for their use cases.

                <h2>Design Principles</h2>
                <p>
                  Based on the target audience insight, we established a set of design principles which guide our design
                  decisions
                </p>
              </div>

                    <h4>Safety & Trust</h4>
                    <p>
                      Unlike Craigslist, HelpMate requires that users are verified with the app in order to create or
                      accept tasks. Helpers
                      and Clients are able to discuss with each other before committing to a task, and leave reviews on
                      their performance. A
                      check-in system instills a sense of assurance for the completion of a task.
                    </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <h4>Flexibility & Support</h4>
                    <p>
                      Students may find it hard to commit to a traditional part-time job due fluctuating schedules.
                      HelpMate’s scheduling
                      flexibility allows Helpers and Clients to organize an appointment without the rigidity of a formal
                      job. In the event of
                      an emergency, users are given the option to reschedule their tasks.

                    </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <h4>Community</h4>
                    <p>
                      We believe there’s more to the relationship between Helpers and Clients than merely monetary
                      exchange. HelpMate seeks to
                      connect different individuals in the community through helping each other and encouraging building
                      relationships, and
                      not only hiring someone to get the job done.

                  To see how the design is performing, the prototype was being tested with 5 University students and 1
                  full-time worker.
                  Utilising a user testing script created by our group member Jessie Li, we also take this chance to get
                  additional user
                  feedback for the general design direction.

                <p>
                  Because of the scope and time constraint of the course, except usability testing, we were mostly
                  working
                  with our secondary research(ie. reddit, reading papers) and assumptions had to be made. We were aware
                  that this is not
                  ideal, however as a design exercise that focuses on the craft of creating user interfaces, I still
                  think
                  this is a successful project. We went through arguments and arguments from the overall direction to
                  the
                  finest details of button
                  placements. The resultis a child of this amazing push and pull dynamics of the team.

                </p>
                <p>
                  Working with these experienced teammates, this project has taught me an important lesson on the
                  attitude
                  of team
                  collaboration and the importance of sharing ideas with the team. As a “perfectionist”, I used to have
                  a
                  very bad habit
                  of holding an idea to myself and refine it before sharing it with the design team, because I was so
                  self
                  conscious about
                  any criticism towards “my idea”. Through this project, I learned to put my ego aside and share
                  unfinished work with
                  colleagues. Couldn't say that I fully overcame this aspect of myself for now, I’ll still get upset
                  sometimes when people
                  say not so good things about my design. However, now I am aware of this tendency of mine when
                  designing,
                  I can figure
                  out ways to deal with it and hopefully slowly I can internalise it.
